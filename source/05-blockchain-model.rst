05. Blockchain model
====================

A DEX - as being deployed on a blockchain - has 4 conceptual "perspectives":

 1. End-user perspective: this covers the view of an end-user, so how the usage of the DEX looks like in practice; this
    would normally coincide with the GUI of the DEX client.
 2. Client-api perspective: this covers the view of a client-developer; is is composed of APIs available to the DEX client
    software; this APIs may communicate to on-chain and off-chain components
 3. Blockchain perspective: this covers the view of a DEX developer and includes all the blockchain-specific solutions.
    used to implement the DEX.
 4. Internal DEX model perspective: this covers the internal working of a DEX, abstracting away from design choices specific
    to a given blockchain where the DEX will be deployed; in the implementation phase this model would typically be
    mapped to a smart-contract.

Here we focus on the the way we mock blockchain architecture in the simulator. This covers perspectives (2) and (3).
